### .. the last PowerToy
# Tweak UIX

This will be my first atempt to recreate a part of the classic Tweak UI featuring the classic look.

## The original

_Tweak UI was part of Windows XP PowerToys and one of the most known Windows PowerToys to tweak the User Interface (UI). With this tool you are able to change settings, which aren't reachable within Windows. Since the release of Windows 95, Microsoft has made available a set of "PowerToys", which is a suite of extra little utilities that Microsoft feels power users would appreciate. Now, after about 25 years, Microsoft has resurrected PowerToys for Windows 10 and Windows 11. But my favorite tool is still missing..._

## The Replica

_[ThisIsWin11](https://github.com/builtbybel/ThisIsWin11/r) was my first attempt to enhance somehow the PowerToys productivity apps with some system tools. It was partly based on tweaks of the TweakUIX mentioned here. Somehow I prefer this standalone version more, so I decided to push it to public on Github. 
My private version had all other tweaks integrated, so the code base including all tweaks of this app was largely taken from the last stable version of the TIW11 OpenTweaks module._

...and yes, this version also brings some advantage over TIW11. The stone-age ui requires less resources and of course flickers a bit smoother on the screen and runs at time of writing also on Win10.
